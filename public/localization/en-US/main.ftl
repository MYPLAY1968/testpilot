eolTitle = Away we go &hellip;
eolMessageOne = After three years and more than twenty experiments,
  <a data-l10n-name="testpilot" title="{- product }">{ -product }</a>
  is touching down for good.
eolMessageTwo = With your generous participation and feedback, we&rsquo;ve shaped { -brand } with amazing new features like { -exp-containers }, { -exp-activity-stream }, and { -exp-screenshots }.
eolMessageThree = We&rsquo;ve also built great new app experiences like { -exp-lockbox } and { -exp-send } which continue to push { -brand } beyond the browser. Look for exciting new developments from both of these projects in 2019.
eolMessageFour = Other experiments like { -exp-color }, { -exp-side-view }, { -exp-price-alerts}, and { -exp-email-tabs } will remain available to the { -brand } community. If you are currently using any of these experiments, no action is required on your part.
eolMessageFive = This blog post provides more detailed information about why { -product } is going away, and what the future will bring.
eolMessageClose = Thank you for flying,
