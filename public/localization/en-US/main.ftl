eolMessageOne = After three years and more than twenty experiments, {-product} is touching down for good.
eolMessageTwo = 
    With your generous participation and feedback, we’ve shaped {-brand} with amazing new features like
    <a data-l10n-name="containersLink" title="{-exp-containers}">{-exp-containers}</a>,
    <a data-l10n-name="activityStreamLink" title="{-exp-activity-stream}">{-exp-activity-stream}</a>, and
    <a data-l10n-name="screenshotsLink" title="{-exp-screenshots}">{-exp-screenshots}</a>.
eolMessageThree =
    We've also built great new app experiences like
    <a data-l10n-name="lockboxLink" title="{-exp-lockbox}">{-exp-lockbox}</a> and
    <a data-l10n-name="sendLink" title="{-exp-send}">{-exp-send}</a>
    which continue to push {-brand} beyond the browser. Look for exciting new developments from both of these projects in 2019.
eolMessageFour =
    Other experiments like
    <a data-l10n-name="colorLink" title={-exp-color}>{-exp-color}</a>,
    <a data-l10n-name="sideViewLink" title={-exp-side-view}>{-exp-side-view}</a>,
    <a data-l10n-name="notesLink" title={-exp-notes}>{ -exp-notes}</a>,
    <a data-l10n-name="priceWiseLink" title={-exp-price-wise}>{-exp-price-wise}</a>, and
    <a data-l10n-name="emailTabsLink" title={-exp-email-tabs}>{-exp-email-tabs}</a>
    will remain available to the { -brand } community. If you have installed these experiments, you can continue to use them.
eolMessageFive =
    This
    <a data-l10n-name="blogPostLink">blog post</a>
    provides more detailed information about why {-product} is going away, and what the future will bring.
